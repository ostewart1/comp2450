## The briefing

The stair from the Crucible's cooling embers descends into a vaulted stone chamber of empty racks, cold crucibles, and **brass molds** — the **Forgemaster's Vault**. In the center stands the **Forgemaster**, silent, a hammer at his belt. He turns and speaks.

You have sorted your spoils. But look at the racks — your inventory, the keep's bestiary, the spellbook yet to come. Three lists. Three shapes. Three separate codes. A waste. This week we press one mold. Stamp it for Items. Stamp it for Monsters. And when a caller asks for steel that is not in the chest — the forge does not crack. It cries out. The game above hears, and recovers, and continues.
</div>
</div>

Last week you sorted. This week you build the **container shape that stamps out a list for any kind of thing**. By Friday, your hero's inventory and the keep's bestiary will both live inside a `Bag<T>` — one class template you wrote, instantiated twice. From the outside, nothing changes. From the inside, one piece of code does the work of two.

You will learn two things, and they are inseparable:

1. **Templates** — one mold, any metal. Write `Bag<T>` once; the compiler stamps a fresh copy for every `T` you instantiate. Function templates first (`findByName<T>` generalizes Floor 1's linear search); class templates next (`Bag<T>` replaces both `std::vector<Item>` and `std::vector<Monster>`).
2. **Exceptions** — when a caller asks for `inventory.at(999)` on a five-item bag, what does the function *return*? Nothing sensible. It **throws** a `BagException`. The main loop catches. The game keeps going. The caller knows exactly what went wrong.

</figure>

  <figcaption><code>inspect 99</code> throws deep inside <code>Bag::at</code>. With <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> in <code>main</code>, the exception unwinds up the call stack into the handler and the command loop continues. Without a catch, the exception escapes <code>main</code>, the runtime calls <code>std::terminate</code>, and the program aborts.</figcaption>
</figure>

You are not rewriting `std::vector` this week — `Bag<T>` is a thin wrapper over it. The point is the **template machinery**, not the storage.

## Objectives

By the end of Floor 3 you will be able to:

- Write a **function template** from scratch — `template<typename T> const T* findByName(const Bag<T>&, const std::string&)`.
- Write a **class template** from scratch — `template<typename T> class Bag`.
- Instantiate the same class template with two different types in the same program and point to where the compiler stamped each copy.
- Define a **custom exception** that inherits from `std::exception` and overrides `what()`.
- Distinguish `operator[]` (no bounds check, fast) from `at()` (bounds check, throws).
- Catch a thrown exception at the right level; predict what happens if the exception escapes `main`.
- Read a template compiler error: find the one line that names the real problem, then trace it from the header the compiler blames back to the line you actually got wrong.

## Pre-class

### Reading (ZyBook Ch. 4 & 5 — both chapters in full)

**Read all of Chapters 4 and 5.** Both chapters in full are the assignment, even the parts class doesn't cover directly. The day-by-day pointers below are the sections *class time* leans on — not the boundary of what you're responsible for.

Before **Monday**: §4.1 Function templates; §4.2 Class templates
Before **Wednesday**: §4.3 C++ example — map values using a function template (the worked example ties Monday and Wednesday together)
Before **Friday**: §5.1 Handling exceptions (`try` / `catch`); §5.2 Throwing exceptions; §5.4 User-defined exceptions; skim §5.5 (a second worked example)

We don't touch files in class this week, so §5.3 (exceptions with files) won't come up in lecture — but it's part of Chapter 5, so read it on your own.

Work the Question Sets and Animations inside each section. The §4.2 animation of a class template being stamped for two different types is exactly what will happen to `Bag<T>` on Wednesday — watch it twice.

There are no pre-class videos. Class time is for live coding and discussion together — your reading is the prep.

## In-class (MWF)

| Day | Focus | Activity |
|-----|-------|----------|
| **M** | Function templates     | Live-code a generic `findByName<T>` together. Replace Floor 1's monster-only `linearSearch` with the template. Call it on the bestiary *and* on the hero's inventory — same source line, two stampings. Watch the compiler error when we call it on a `Bag<int>`. |
| **W** | Class templates        | Live-code `Bag<T>` from the starter declaration. Rewrite `Hero.h` so the inventory is `Bag<Item>`; rewrite the bestiary to be `Bag<Monster>`. Commit when `inventory`, `bestiary`, `search`, and `sort inventory` all run off one class template. |
| **F** | Exceptions             | Write `BagException : public std::exception`. Make `at()` throw on bad index. Wrap the main command loop in `try`/`catch`. Plant a deliberate bad call — watch the game *not* crash. Discussion: what must *not* go in a catch block, and why `catch(...) { }` is worse than no catch at all. |

## The project — Floor 3

This week's project increment is **one container shape shared across the whole game**.

You will receive (in your starter drop):

- Everything through Floor 2, fully working — `search`, `sort inventory by <criterion>`, all three benchmarks from Floor 1 and Floor 2.
- A header `hero/Bag.h` with the class template declaration — `template<typename T> class Bag`, private `std::vector<T>` member, and signatures for every method you need to implement.
- A header `hero/BagException.h` — a user-defined exception derived from `std::exception` with a `what()` message.
- A header `bestiary/Search.h` with the new `findByName<T>` function template declaration (Floor 1's monster-specific searches are still there, kept as reference — you are not editing them this week).
- A working **Floor 2 baseline**: `hero/Hero.h` still stores the inventory as a `std::vector<Item>`, and `main.cpp` still calls the Floor 1 search. Everything compiles and runs the moment you unzip it. Your job this week is to *flip* that storage to `Bag<T>` and wire in the template — the starter does not ship broken. Each TODO marker in the code names the day it's due.

You will write:

1. **Monday:** `findByName<T>` in `bestiary/Search.h` (templates live in headers). Rewire `main.cpp`'s `search` command to call the template. Demonstrate calling it on both the bestiary and your inventory — same source template, two instantiations. (This week the parameter starts as `std::vector<T>`; Wednesday you flip it to `Bag<T>` and the body never changes.)
2. **Wednesday:** `Bag<T>` — `push_back`, `size`, `empty`, `operator[]`, `begin`/`end` (delegate to the underlying `std::vector`), `clear`. When this is done, `inventory`, `sort inventory`, and `search` all run through it.
3. **Friday:** `BagException`, `Bag<T>::at()` that throws on bad index, and a `try`/`catch` around the main command dispatch in `main.cpp`. A bad `inspect 99` must print a clean error and return to the prompt.

Demo target (Friday):

```
> inventory
   1.  Rusty sword       (wt 4.0, val 5)
   2.  Healing potion    (wt 0.5, val 12)
   3.  Iron key          (wt 0.1, val 0)
   4.  Loaf of bread     (wt 0.1, val 1)
   5.  Cloak of shadows  (wt 1.5, val 80)
> list
Bone Spider   HP 6   ATK 2   weakness: fire
Cave Troll   HP 28   ATK 7   weakness: fire
Cinder Bat   HP 4   ATK 1   weakness: water
Frostmaw   HP 22   ATK 6   weakness: fire
Goblin   HP 8   ATK 2   weakness: fire
   ... (all 15 monsters, sorted by name)
Wraith   HP 14   ATK 4   weakness: holy
   (same Bag<T> — different T)
> search Goblin
Goblin   HP 8   ATK 2   weakness: fire
> search Iron key
  Iron key          (wt 0.1, val 0)
   (same findByName<T> — two instantiations)
> inspect 3
  Iron key  (wt 0.1, val 0)
> inspect 99
No such item. (index 98 out of bounds for size 5)
   (game keeps running — the catch block handled it)
> sort inventory by weight
   1.  Iron key          (wt 0.1, val 0)
   2.  Loaf of bread     (wt 0.1, val 1)
   3.  Healing potion    (wt 0.5, val 12)
   4.  Cloak of shadows  (wt 1.5, val 80)
   5.  Rusty sword       (wt 4.0, val 5)
```

The indented parenthetical lines above are notes to you, not program output. Note
that `inspect 99` reports index **98** — `inspect` is 1-based for the player, so
`n - 1` is what reaches `Bag::at`.

### Lab 3 — *One Mold, Many Shapes* (folded into the project)

There is no separate lab handout. The work you do this week *is* the lab.

Commit `floor-03/lab-notes.md` to your project repo with the five items below.
Two of them ask you to break something on purpose and watch what happens —
restore your code afterward. Two ask you to reason on paper, with no build at
all; those are graded on the precision of the reasoning, not its length.

1. **The transcript.** A transcript of the demo above, pasted from your terminal.

2. **Break it — the template error.** Inside `main()` in `main.cpp`, directly above the `printHelp();` call, add exactly these two lines and change nothing else:

   ```cpp
   Bag<int> numbers;
   findByName(numbers, "seven");
   ```

   It will not compile — that is the point. **Copy the error from the Output window, not the Error List pane:** the Error List shows only the one-line summary, and the part this question is about (the indented `template instantiation context` block naming your own line in `main.cpp`) appears only in Output. Paste all of it. Then answer: which **file and line** does the compiler blame, which line did *you* actually get wrong, and why are those two different? Note that `numbers` is empty — the loop inside `findByName` could never run even once. Why does that not save you? Delete the two lines when you are done.

3. **Break it — the Swallowed Scream.** `main.cpp` has more than one `catch`. You want the **outer** one — the handler wrapping the whole command dispatch, the one whose body prints `No such item.` (*not* either of the small inner `catch (...)` blocks that handle a bad number in `inspect` or `benchmark`). Replace that entire handler, declaration and body together, so that

   ```cpp
   catch (const std::exception& e) {
       std::cout << "No such item. (" << e.what() << ")\n";
   }
   ```

   becomes

   ```cpp
   catch (...) { }
   ```

   The old body has to go: `catch (...)` names no exception object, so a body still calling `e.what()` will not compile. Rebuild, then run `inspect 99` followed by `inspect 3`. Describe *exactly* what appears on screen, including what does **not** appear. Then: deleting the handler altogether would make the program die outright. Explain why the empty handler is **worse** than dying. Restore your real handler.

4. **On paper — checked vs. unchecked.** No code for this one. A teammate opens a pull request changing `inspect`'s `hero.inventory.at(n - 1)` to `hero.inventory[n - 1]`, with the note *"at() is slower and we already validate the input upstream."* Write the review comment you would leave. It has to name (a) a specific command a player could type that breaks it, (b) what the program is now permitted to do instead of throwing, and (c) why *"I tested it and it worked"* is not evidence that the change is safe. Finish with one sentence naming the single situation where their change would be the right call.

5. **On paper — why `std::exception`.** No code for this one either. Suppose `BagException` did **not** inherit from `std::exception`. It would still compile: `throw` accepts any type at all, and `what()` would still be there. Explain which line in `main.cpp` silently stops doing its job, what the player sees instead when they type `inspect 99`, and why the compiler cannot warn you about it. Then: what is the smallest change to `main.cpp` that makes it work again, and what does that change cost you every time the game grows a new kind of failure?

Your commit history this week should show at least three commits — Mon (function template), Wed (class template), Fri (exceptions + lab notes).

*Best trick I ever learned*, friend! When the program shouts at you — *`catch(...) { }`.* Empty inside. No words! The shouting stops. No more errors. No more crashes. **You're welcome.**

**The Swallowed Scream** — *HP: ∞. Damage: invisible, cumulative.*
Strikes when a programmer, panicked by a crash, wraps bad code in `catch(...) { }` to make the error "go away." The program no longer crashes. It also no longer works. Bugs are no longer reported. The inventory command silently does nothing half the time. A boss fight ends with the player at zero HP and no message. The Swallowed Scream does not kill you. It removes your ability to *notice* that something is killing you.

Counter by:

- **Catch at the level where you can actually do something about it.** The main command loop can say "command failed: {what}" and return to the prompt. A two-line helper in the middle of a subsystem usually cannot — let the exception propagate.
- **Never write `catch(...) { }` with an empty body.** At a minimum, log. Better: rethrow after logging. Best: don't catch at this level at all.
- **Inherit from `std::exception`.** The catch block can then ask `e.what()` and print something useful. A raw `throw 42;` is technically legal C++ and produces an error message a caller cannot read.

This floor ends the way every floor ends: with a short stack of paper questions in class — closed notes, closed laptop, answers in your own hand — drawn from everything this floor taught. If you did the reading, wrote the code, and can say *why* this week's work earns its place in the game, it takes ten minutes.

But first, [**Midterm 1**]({{ site.baseurl }}/floors/warden-01/) stands between you and Floor 4. The **Warden of the Foundations** tests Floors 0 – 3 together. Prepare for it.

*The Forgemaster sets down his hammer. The mold cools. One forge has stamped two containers, and when the forge is asked for steel that isn't there, it cries out instead of cracking. Above the far door the first warden stirs — the **Warden of the Foundations** — where every lesson from the Antechamber through the Vault is put to the test. Pass, and the stair to Floor 4 — the **Chain Vault** — opens.*
