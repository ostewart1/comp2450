// COMP 2450 — Warden of the Foundations starter (post-Floor-3 reference state)
// hero/BagException.h — completed Floor 3 (Friday) reference.
//
// A user-defined exception. Inherits from std::exception so the standard
//     try { … } catch (const std::exception& e) { std::cout << e.what(); }
// pattern works out of the box. ZyBook §5.4 is the worked example; this
// is the version we use in the game.
//
// We keep the entire class in this header (constructor inline, what()
// inline) — it is small enough that a separate .cpp would be overhead
// with no gain. Not a template, though; template is the next file over.
